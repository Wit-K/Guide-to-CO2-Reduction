# The Hardware Guide
*How to set up an electrolysis station without a university budget.*

---

## 1. The Challenge: The "H-Cell"
In professional labs, scientists use a two-chamber glass cell separated by an ion-exchange membrane (like Nafion). This prevents the products made at the cathode from getting oxidized back at the anode.
*   **Professional Cost:** $300 - $1,000
*   **Student Solution:** Two Beakers + A Salt Bridge.

## 2. The Bill of Materials (BOM)

### A. The Power Source
Instead of a $5,000 Potentiostat, we can use a basic DC Power Supply.
*   **Item:** Adjustable DC Power Supply (0-30V, 0-5A)
*   **Cost:** ~$50 on Amazon/AliExpress.
*   **Alternative:** 9V Batteries (harder to control voltage, but possible).

### B. The Electrodes
*   **Cathode (Working Electrode):** Copper Foil.
    *   *Why?* Copper is one of the only metals capable of making hydrocarbons (methane/ethylene).
    *   *Source:* Hobby shops or hardware stores (make sure it's pure copper).
*   **Anode (Counter Electrode):** Platinum wire is standard, but **Graphite (Carbon)** rods work for students.
    *   *Source:* Thick pencil lead or welding rods.

### C. The "Separator" (Crucial)
You need to connect the two beakers so ions flow, but liquids don't mix.
*   **The Hack:** A Salt Bridge.
*   **Recipe:** Mix Agar powder + Potassium Chloride (KCl) or simple table salt (NaCl) in hot water, pour into a U-tube or plastic tubing, and let it gel.

## 3. The Setup Diagram
*(We will insert a diagram here in the next step)*

1.  **Left Beaker (Cathode):** Fill with CO2-saturated electrolyte (Baking Soda + Water).
2.  **Right Beaker (Anode):** Fill with electrolyte.
3.  **Bridge:** Connect them with the Salt Bridge.
4.  **Power:** Connect Negative (-) to Copper, Positive (+) to Graphite.

## 4. Why this works
By separating the chambers, we ensure that the $O_2$ produced at the anode doesn't mess up the delicate reduction happening at the copper cathode.
