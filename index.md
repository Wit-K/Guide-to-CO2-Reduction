# Electrochemical CO2 Reduction
**A Beginner-Friendly and Complete Manual for High School Researchers**

---

## Introduction
The leap from high school AP/IB Chemistry to actual academic research is often overwhelming. While standard curricula cover redox reactions and stoichiometry, they rarely touch on the complexities of modern electrocatalysis—a field critical for solving the climate crisis.

**"Artificial Photosynthesis"** (Electrochemical CO2 Reduction) is one of the most promising fields in sustainable energy. It attempts to do what plants do: take carbon dioxide and water, and use energy to convert them into useful chemicals.

## Why I Wrote This Guide
When I started exploring this topic, I hit a wall. Academic papers are written for PhDs, often skipping over the "basics" that a student needs to know. Furthermore, the equipment listed in these papers often costs thousands of dollars.

**The goal of this manual is simple:** to translate complex electrochemical theory into a language accessible to high schoolers, and to demonstrate how to perform valid experiments without a university-level budget.

## What You Need to Know
This guide assumes you have a basic grasp of chemistry (oxidation states, moles, and balancing equations). From there, we will build up to:
*   **Thermodynamics:** Why CO2 is so stable and hard to break.
*   **Kinetics:** How catalysts like Copper work to speed up the reaction.
*   **Engineering:** How to build an "H-Cell" to separate your products.

## The Manual

### [1. The Theory](./theory)
A breakdown of the reaction mechanisms. We look at the competition between CO2 reduction and Hydrogen evolution, and why the cathode material matters.

### [2. The Build: DIY Setup](./equipment)
A practical guide to hardware. How to substitute expensive potentiostats for DC power supplies, and how to create salt bridges instead of buying Nafion membranes.

### [3. Safety Protocols (Coming Soon)](./)
**Crucial:** Handling Carbon Monoxide (CO) risks and electrical safety in a wet environment. Do not attempt experiments without reading this.
