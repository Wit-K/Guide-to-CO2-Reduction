# Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: A Student Guide
**Democratizing Artificial Photosynthesis for High School Researchers**

## Why This Matters
As carbon dioxide levels rise, we need solutions. This project explores how we can use electricity to turn CO2 into useful fuels—right from a high school lab.

## What You Will Learn
1. **The Theory:** Understanding Redox reactions.
2. **The Build:** How to build an electrolysis cell for under $100.
3. **The Data:** How to measure results safely.

## Guide Chapters

### [1. The Theory](./theory)
Understanding redox reactions, thermodynamics, and why CO2 is so hard to break.

### [2. The Build (Coming Soon)](./)
How to build an H-Cell for under $100.

### [3. Safety (Coming Soon)](./)
Handling CO gas and high currents safely.
