# Electrochemical CO2 Reduction
**A practical, beginner-friendly guide for starting research**

---

## The Motivation
Electrochemical CO₂ reduction is widely discussed in research papers, but difficult to approach as a beginner. Most available resources either focus on abstract theory or assume prior experience and complete equipments. As a result, newcomers often struggle to picture and understand how experiments are designed, how data are interpreted and what it actually means.

This guide aims to bridge that gap. Its goal is to organize concepts, design logic, and data interpretation in a way that is easy to comprehend as beginners, while keeping standard of how the field is in real research.

## Who is this for?
*   **Student Researchers:** Students looking to conduct independent research projects or transitioning from theory to experiment.
*   **Beginners:** Anyone with a basic chemistry background attempting their first electrolysis experiments.
*   **Readers:** Readers who want clear concept map before diving into literature.
