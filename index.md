# Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: A Student Guide
**Democratizing Artificial Photosynthesis for High School Researchers**

## Why This Matters
As carbon dioxide levels rise, we need solutions. This project explores how we can use electricity to turn CO2 into useful fuels—right from a high school lab.

## What You Will Learn
1. **The Theory:** Understanding Redox reactions.
2. **The Build:** How to build an electrolysis cell for under $100.
3. **The Data:** How to measure results safely.

## Quick Equation Test
Does this look like a math formula?
$$ CO_2 + 2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow CO + H_2O $$
