# Curated Resources
*Essential Literature for the CO2 Reduction Researcher*

---

## 1. The Foundation

*   **Hori et al. (1985/1989) - Metal Catalysis:** The original work classifying metals into distinct groups based on their CO2 reduction products. Crucial for understanding copper's unique role.
*   **Kuhl et al. (2012) - Copper Product Mapping:** A modern benchmark paper detailing the wide range of products (over 16) achievable from copper electrodes under different conditions. A standard for comparing your own copper data.

## 2. Methodology & Best Practices

*   **Clark et al. (2018) - Standardization Protocols:** A comprehensive guide on best practices for data acquisition, current density calculations, and error reporting in CO2 reduction studies.
*   **Wuttig & Surendranath (2015) - Impurity Effects:** Demonstrates how trace metal impurities can dramatically alter catalytic performance, highlighting the critical importance of high-purity chemicals and clean glassware.

## 3. Mechanism & Theory Reviews

*   **Nitopi et al. (2019) - Comprehensive Review:** A detailed review article explaining the step-by-step molecular mechanisms of CO2 reduction on copper surfaces, including the formation of C-C bonds.
*   **Kortlever et al. (2015) - Catalysts & Pathways:** A more concise review focusing on why different catalysts lead to different products (e.g., C1 vs. C2 pathways).
